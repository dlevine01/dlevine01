👋 Hi, I’m Dan


🏙 I work to make cities better  
👯 for the people who live there

🗺 I make maps   
📃 and research policy

🏫 I've just finished a masters degree in applied data science and spatial analysis at NYU's [Center for Urban Science and Progress](https://cusp.nyu.edu)   

I want to use data analysis tools to solve city challenges through policy change.
